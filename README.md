# my-wish-list

## A wish list of projects & ideas that I want to explore and keep track of as an independent AI researcher.

### Alpha trends to be apart of
1. **Mechanistic Interpretability:** Would be fun to be a neurosurgeon for LLMs.
2. **Small model optimization:** Why go big when smaller models can be better at tasks (like reasoning).
3. **ARC-AGI:** A benchmark yet to be broken. Hints towards Neurosymbolic AI. 

### Ideas 
1. **mapTree:** A tree-based roadmap/planning app of things that I have learnt or want to learn where I can add anything that I wish for.
2. **HALO-Bot:** I like gaming. Playing Halo CE was my best childhood memory. Now I make a RL bot that can play it for me.
   - Next steps would to generalize it to play any RPG game.
3. **HummAI:** I like music but I can't play any instrument but I can hum it. Would be good if I can play it straight out of my mind.
   - Next steps would be to create images.
5. **EvoAI:** I don't like the idea of current NN based AIs performance to be data dependent. Would be interesting if they can evolve to learn automatically.
